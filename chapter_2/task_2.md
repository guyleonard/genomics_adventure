# Task 2 - Evaluating the Quality of Illumina Data Continues...
Do the same for read 2 as we have for read 1. Open fastqc and analyse the read 2 file. Look at the
various plots and metrics which are generated. How similar are they?

Note that the number of reads reported in both files is identical. Overall, both read 1 and read 2 can be regarded as 'good' data-sets.
