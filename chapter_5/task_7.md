# Task 7 - IGV O'clock!

Load your assembled genome - click on "Genome - Load from File..."

Make sure you get the contigs.fasta from the "hybrid" asembly (igv remembers the previous directory which may contain similar files.)

Now load your 2 alignment files - click on "Load from File..." and then select pseudo.pacbio.sorted.bam and pseudo.illumina.sorted.bam

Find a region that has decent coverage of both reads and zoom in.

You can see that the PacBio reads are much longer, but the error rate particularly insertions and deletions is much higher than for the Illumina reads.

Explore a few other contigs to see if you can find something that looks like an error or mis-assembly. Remember the assembly process is difficult and far from perfect.
