# Task 8 - Summary & Conclusion!

You have seen that de-novo assembly of short reads is a challenging problem. Even for small genomes, the resulting assembly is fragmented into contigs and far from complete.

Incorporating longer reads to produce a hybrid assembly can be used to reduce the fragmentation of the genome. We have only used a single (perhaps the simplest) technique to incorporate long reads. You can read more about hybrid assembly techniques [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930142) :mag:.

## Concluding Remarks

Well done! If you have reached this far, you deserve a round of applause :clap: and probably a beer :beer: or whatever you prefer to celebrate with!

You have completed some of the most common tasks in genomics. You can use same operating procedures to perform an analysis of any dataset, including your own data!
