# Task 4 - View Assembly in IGV

You are by now experts at this bit, load up IGV from the console or desktop adn click "Genomes --> Load Genome from File..."

We are going to import the contigs we have assembled as the reference. Unlike the reference genome though, we have no annotation available. Make sure you select the contigs.fasta file for
the complete de novo assembly (not the unmapped reads assembly).

Once loaded, click on "File --> Load From File..." and select the contigs_mapped.sorted.bam file. Again mak sure you load the file in the "remapping_to_assembly" directory.

Once loaded, explore some of the contigs in IGV. See if you can find anything unusual in any of the contigs.
